This is an attempt to make a single source of truth for all recipes that we use
to cook meals. The intent is to use Drupal to store all recipes and their
ingredients, then create an interface (most likely using Views) to easily find
recipes that can be created using the ingredients listed.

It should be pretty simple. Let's hope.
